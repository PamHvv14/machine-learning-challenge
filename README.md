Homework #16 Data Analytics Bootcamp

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called machine-learning-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Give each model you choose their own Jupyter notebook, do not use more than one model per notebook.


Save your best model to a file. This will be the model used to test your accuracy and used for grading.


Commit your Jupyter notebooks and model file and push them to GitHub.


Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
In this homework assignment, you will need to:

Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models
